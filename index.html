                summons you to fulfill your duty to him as his subject. You are ordered to
                fill out this form so that we can organize you into proper ranks and file.
                Submit the form early and you will get first dibs on looting and pillaging.
                You would do well to remember that those who do not submit the form at 
                all will be rounded up and placed in the front lines. Also, if you do
                not know how to write or if you lost your writing arm in the last war you
                can come down to the castle and we will help you fill out the form. See the front gate
                for opening hours.
